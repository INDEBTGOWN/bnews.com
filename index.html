        <p class="leading-relaxed text-lg">According to the latest information from our beloved school "Dhila Pant Shirt(aka DPS NN)" situated between the extreme road for Global NCAP testing(Angul-Banarpal Road) has lost a legend on Sept 14 around 10pm.
            He was enjoying his time in bed in chilled A/C when a lizard fell on his TAKLA, due to the fear from that lizard he DIVED from the bed and broke his leg. While he was taken to hospital a elephant names Sunyasat tried to stop him with his huge body of fat and was successful in it also
            
            He is none other than our fav HKM(aka Haada Kankaala Maaniisa OR Hitler Killer Man) sir.
            DPS NN's one and only IT teacher who did extracuricular activities instead of teaching...like ladiyan taadna(especially Sreeja and Sanvi), derieving the meaning of the names of girls, teaching about life lesson etc
            
            He spent only 5 mins in teaching and then started his nuisance which again Sreeja and Sanvi loved. But then also those two girls with their rattafication power scored the highest marks in IT.
            When students asked that idiot to go to pratical lab, he always asked them what was pratical and was an computer.
            
            He was so much loved by all the students that in class IX-B children were planning to make fun of him by making him sit on a broken chair but they failed.
            
            
            On this auspicious day, everyone should celebrate that our beloved teacher went straight to HELL, not even asked if he will go to heaven or not.
            
            
            For more info about this guy pls contact Sreeja and Sanvi...
