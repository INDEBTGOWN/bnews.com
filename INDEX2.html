                He always give up life lessons that we shouldn't ateend tutions, maintain a good posture, and not to wear a MASK.
                He was a teacher of his kind who literally would enjoy talikng to any girl whom he saw in the corridor.
                
                But at last he got a prize for his kindness towards the students....DEATH!
